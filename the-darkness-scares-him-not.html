<p class="p5">The Darkness Scares Him Not</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">by Todd Crone</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Charlie was my closest friend at EvilCorp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sat with me at lunch and listened to all my rants while nodding his support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nursed drinks as I rambled on about the injustices I endured on my projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He even tolerated my complaining in the break room as he sucked Dorrito (or Cheeto) dust off his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Charlie was a good work pal until the day of the big presentation.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“You ready for this man?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Charlie said as he peeked over my cube wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seemed bored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had no idea how he achieved that relaxed state at our office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed as though I was always chasing the next deadline, whereas Charlie never seemed to care that he had never met a deadline. Some days, I envied him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today was one of those days.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yeah,” I said as I worked on my last few slides.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“You sure you wanna do this?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Charlie said with an oddly serious tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was not his way.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Ed’s not gonna like it,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was right.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Fuck Ed, I thought.</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></i>“Maybe Ed <i>should </i>like it,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Ed likes money,” Charlie said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was right again, and the suggestions in my presentation were certainly not going to make the company more money, at least not in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I have to do this,” I said with a measure of resolve.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Charlie nodded as he always did and said, “Okay, I’m with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>He wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">#</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With less than a minute until meeting time, I finished the last slide, closed my laptop, adjusted my glasses, looked at Charlie, and said, “Let’s do this.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Charlie smiled back and offered me the hallway with a sweeping bow of mock deference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My eyes rolled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I wouldn’t let him kill my enthusiasm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was doing something important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was taking my project—our company—to the next level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Away from the narrow, focused mindset of the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Away from mediocrity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would show everyone how cutting corners to make an arbitrary deadline at the expense of quality was short-sighted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that finishing a project under budget means nothing if the result doesn’t delight our customers.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As I approached the conference room, I could see it was full of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first, I was thrilled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, I was nauseous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could feel the red heat rising on my face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cold sweat formed on my ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Why my ears?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></i>Charlie looked back at me with big eyes and an uncomfortable smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was bigger than we expected.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>That was the moment my good friend Charlie failed me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his cell phone and quickly placed it up to his ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His face became a serious mask.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Looking back at me, he raised his index finger and mouthed, ‘<i>One minute.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Then he bailed on me.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">#</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As I crossed the threshold, I saw the room was filled beyond capacity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The thralls from my company were out in force.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To most of them, this meeting was an hour they didn’t have to spend at their desks pretending to be productive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They just wanted to get through the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maintain the status quo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing I said would likely move them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I had to try.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Amongst them were the “meeting moths” that couldn’t help but be drawn to any conference room with three or more people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They weren’t invited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They didn’t even know what this meeting was about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you could be assured they would find some way to “contribute.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These people were lost outside of a meeting, and they were the first to suggest a follow-up meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The infamous meeting to discuss the meeting.</p>
<p class="p7">My favorite people were standing in the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pete, Paul, and Tom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were each at the same level in the company as me and worked on similar projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you run into these guys in the hallway, they act like your best friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They quickly commend you on your work with a “Good job, bud” or an “Awesome work, bro.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in the conference room—their arena—they are your enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They will do anything to nominalize your work in front of as many people as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is always easier for them to pump themselves up by knocking down some of the competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And instead of offering suggestions privately BEFORE the big meeting so you can make adjustments and improve your presentation, they take mental notes on early drafts so they can act smart during the actual meeting and take you down a notch or two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, these guys are the worst.</p>
<p class="p7">At this point, I realized all eyes were on me.</p>
<p class="p7">“Ok,” I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”I’ve created this presentation to show how we can improve the quality of our current and future projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will help us retain customers and gain new ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope you enjoy it.”</p>
<p class="p7">The first slide appeared on the screen, and the room faded away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I fell into a rhythm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A dreamlike state enveloped me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Slides magically transitioned to the next and the next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t even aware I was holding the control in my hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I discussed adjustments to our process and cited studies that supported them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We could improve the quality of our work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would take more time and cost more initially, but in the long run, our customers would appreciate our improvements, and we would grow our business through word of mouth and reputation more than aggressive marketing schemes.</p>
<p class="p7">Open faces nodded all around the room throughout the presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thirty-two minutes later, I was done, and relief coursed through my body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Modest applause, and it is over.</p>
<p class="p7">“Any questions?” I said, hoping that I might get some good ones.</p>
<p class="p7">Tom’s hand raised.</p>
<p class="p7">Lovely.</p>
<p class="p7">“Yeah, Tom,” I said reluctantly, pointing to the back of the room.</p>
<p class="p7">“Has Ed seen any of this yet?” he said.</p>
<p class="p7">I hesitated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt my face getting hot again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time, it wasn’t because of anxiety.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I took a few deep breaths to keep my cool.</p>
<p class="p7">“I haven’t spoken to him yet,” I said as groans erupted and frowns fell.</p>
<p class="p7">I lost them.</p>
<p class="p7">Tom smiled at Paul and Pete.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They all shook their heads in silent agreement.</p>
<p class="p7">The conference room started to clear as I collected my laptop and what was left of my dignity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Paul came up to me smiling and faked a punch to the chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know why he always does that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did he box in college?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s always shadowboxing with Pete and Tom in the hallways between meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why is it my turn all of a sudden?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s pretty annoying, but I smile awkwardly.</p>
<p class="p7">“Great prez, bro!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let us know when you’ve shown this to Ed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’d REALLY like to implement some of these things,” he said with a hint of victory, then headed towards the door with the rest of the mob.</p>
<p class="p7">Out in the hallway, Charlie was waiting for me.</p>
<p class="p7">“Good job, man,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”I saw it from here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to interrupt after you got going.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It looked like it went really well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think Ed might actually go for it.”</p>
<p class="p7">No, he won’t.</p>
<p class="p5">#</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Back at my cube, Charlie came over and acted like nothing happened.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Hey man, wanna go to that new Mexican place after work for some margaritas?” he said, then noticed I was packing my stuff into a pathetic little box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I’m going to talk to Ed,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Okay?” he said, hanging on that ‘ay’ for a bit as the confusion on his face intensified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a gift he has.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blankness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another one I wish I had occasionally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now would be nice.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>I glared at him, waiting for him to figure it out, then returned to packing a bobblehead barely holding together after being knocked off the shelf multiple times by errant Nerf shots from Charlie across the cube farm.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“When Ed rejects my ideas, I’m quitting,” I said, throwing the bobblehead in the trash.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The confusion left his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t you mean if?” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Sure, Charlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If,” I said, dropping a stapler into my pathetic little box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After I tossed in a few more things, I grabbed the box with both hands and glared at him again, waiting for more insight.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>He put his hands up in surrender and backed away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a brief frown, his eyes met mine, and I sensed the slightest look of disappointment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he turned and made his way back to his cube.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">#</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Moments later, I stood on the precipice of Ed’s office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The top dog.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The big kahuna.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The project manager.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sat my pathetic little box beside the door, straightened my shirt, messed with my hair, and knocked.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Come in,” he said from the other side.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As I opened the door, the smell of a Bahama breeze hit me squarely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For some reason, his office always smelled better and looked cleaner than the rest of the office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even his bookcase looked dust-free; I’m confident this guy rarely reads.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The books most prominently displayed were “Leadership,” “The Effective Executive,” and my favorite, “The Art of War”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All for show, of course.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>He was on the phone, sporting a blank smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gestured me in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t tell if the smile was for me, whoever was on the phone, or if he had just grinned his way through so much shit that this was the default expression frozen on his face.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Okay, honey, I have something here I need to deal with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll call you later,” then he hung up with a beep.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>He had something here he needed to deal with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lovely.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I heard you made a big impression on everyone this afternoon,” he said, still smiling but eyes narrowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could tell he was trying to figure out what I was after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of his spies had most certainly told him about the meeting, and he’d had time to mull it over.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes, I think we can do better for our customers with some minor adjustments to our process,” I said, sticking to my guns.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>He leaned back in his chair, hands behind his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes dug into me, but for once, I didn’t feel the need to look away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, I stared right back through him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I noticed he was sitting in a chair from the new conference room down on the third floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the chairs he specifically told the rest of us not to touch in a very condescending email.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rest of us had old chairs that had seen better days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were likely brought over from the last company that our executives drove into the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Leaning forward in his stolen chair, he placed his hands squarely on his cherry desk and said,” I can appreciate that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, he couldn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”Unfortunately, we cannot afford the extra time or expense,” Another lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You understand, right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes stayed focused on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His smile was gone.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“No,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“No?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sorry?” he said, a hint of a grin forming on his smug face.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I said no, Ed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not going to understand.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He squinted and prepared himself to interrupt me, so I didn’t let him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”I’m also not going to get myself worked up trying to rehash something I already covered in a detailed presentation that you couldn’t be bothered to walk down the hall and stick your head in to see,” I hesitated towards the end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to say “big FAT head,” but I caught myself.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Well, then I’m not sure where we are then,” Ed said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His shoulders crept forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was preparing for me to say something he could use later to discredit me and everything I’ve tried to communicate today.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I quit,” I said, realizing the longer I stay in Ed’s office, the more likely I will chuck one of those management books that he has never read out the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gathered myself and headed for the door.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“You realize if you quit on me, I’ll ensure your career is dead?” he said, letting the last word hang in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>I paused briefly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, I continued out the door, picked up my pathetic little box, and headed out.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A few moments later, I stood before the elevators, clinging to my pathetic little box, and considered heading over to Charlie’s cube and saying goodbye when Pete walked up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took a bite of an apple I’m confident he stole from the third-floor conference room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fruit basket down there got replenished each week, but everyone knew the fruit was for prospective clients, not employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another fact that Ed had made abundantly clear in a managerial email to the rest of us serfs.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“You gotta push the button, bro,” Pete said, leaning around me, pushing the down arrow, and giving me a healthy clap on the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I fought the urge to say something back, and Pete continued down the hallway, tossing the partially eaten, stolen apple in the trash can along the way.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">#</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>At home, I went through the typical ritual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I threw my mail (mostly bills, junk mail, and stuff addressed to some dude no one in the apartment complex seemed to remember) on the kitchen table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I checked the fridge for food and found none (at least nothing safe to eat anymore).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I grabbed a beer, sat on my lumpy couch, turned on the TV, and looked for something to watch for a few hours until hunger forced me to order some takeout.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As I scrolled through available shows, I noticed some papers poking out of another pathetic little box that I must have shoved under my entertainment center shortly after I moved in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pulled it out and saw it was full of crap my best friend back home gave me before I moved away to that city with that job that would “change everything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the box, he’d dumped all sorts of things I’d left at his place over the years.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Amongst the high school yearbook, an old deck of cards, a map of medieval Europe, and a Harry Potter book (never read it), I found a short story I wrote in middle school wrapped in black construction paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first page has a crude colored pencil drawing of a cloaked, mounted figure on a green ridge with trees going down the side and a two-dimensional sun.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>I read the title and smiled.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>The Darkness Scares Him Not…</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></i>Just holding it, I remembered the pure joy I had writing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Streaming services be damned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This deserved a read.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">#</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>After a brief moment, he said,” I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="p7">Author’s Notes:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did write a short story in middle school (called junior high for me) called “The Darkness Scares Him Not…”. Hopefully, I will be able to include the picture I drew for it cause it did give me sentimental solid feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was sitting at my desk pondering a modern take on Pinnochio where the characters were female.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I won’t go into more cause I might write it yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But as I was considering this and taking notes, I just happened to be looking at my bookcase and saw the black construction paper poking out, and it occurred to me that my old story could be a fairy tale of sorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then we talked a little about gothic style in class, and I just HAD to make it more gothic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had ideas of keeping it intact, but it was ten pages long and well…I wrote it when I was 13 or 14.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, I included a heavily edited and trimmed version, but the first sentence is the same, and the premise and characters are the same.</p>
<p class="p5">#</p>
<p class="p7">Couple questions:</p>
<p class="p7">1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where are some places that were confusing or awkward?</p>
<p class="p7">2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were the short and main story parallels easy to see but not too obvious?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted someone to notice but didn’t want to be too blatant.</p>
<p class="p7">3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did the old short story from middle school feel more gothic and separate from the rest of the story?</p>
<p class="p7">4.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was having the old short story entirely in italics okay?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was it helpful or unnecessary?</p>
